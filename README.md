# Visual-Question-Answering

Welcome to our Visual Question Answering project! Our goal is to create an intelligent system that can answer simple questions about images. We've created a user-friendly web application that allows you to interact with our system and see its capabilities in action.

## Dataset
For this project, we used the [VizWiz](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lhanhsin/vizwiz/data) dataset. It is a large-scale visual question answering dataset that contains

* 20,523 training image/question pairs
* 205,230 training answer/answer confidence pairs
* 4,319 validation image/question pairs
* 43,190 validation answer/answer confidence pairs
* 8,000 test image/question pairs
  
Dataset files are as follows:

*Images: training, validation, and test sets

*Annotations: Visual questions are split into three JSON files: train, validation, and test. Answers are publicly shared for the train and validation splits and hidden for the test split.
